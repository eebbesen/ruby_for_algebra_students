Small lessons in Ruby solving algebra questions

or 

# Intro to computing using Ruby to do your algebra homework

## What you need for this to make sense
1. Computer with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) _or_ a web browser that can use [this site](https://repl.it/languages/ruby)
2. Some experience with algebra


## Lesson order
Here's the order I use, but you are free to do what you want

1. variables
2. collections
3. methods
4. enumerators
5. looping_with_each

## Is this for me?
My goal with this project is to determine whether it is possible to trick my tweens into learning some Ruby on accident while they think they're avoiding learning algebra.

My tweens haven't been too excited about they myriad of programming books/tutorials/websites I've forced them to try.  I'm attempting to sell Ruby/programming as a tool they can use to make their lives easier as they do their math homework.

What I type and what discuss in the ten- to twenty-minute sessions is very limited:

So there's a lot I don't even want to tell people -- if they are excited about Ruby and want to look all that stuff up on their own and/or learn from other resources, great!  

## That answer is too long.  Can you give a shorter answer?
### If you are looking for a general Ruby/programming tutorial, this isn't for you.  
These lessons are focused on using Ruby for not very complicated math.

These lessons do not use or refer to:
* `String`s.  That's right, no "Hello, World!".

These lessons avoid discussing the following:
* What IRB is
* The fact that arrays are zero-based
* What blocks are.  That's right, I don't talk about scope.
* What Ruby is
* Who Matz is
* Why Ruby is better than Java
* Why Ruby is worse than than Haskell
* Why JRuby is better than Haskell
