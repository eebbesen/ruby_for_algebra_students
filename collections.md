## Collections 

Collections are groups of things.  The collections we're going to talk about are collections of numbers.  We will use collections so we can type less code.

We will *not* be typing sequences of numbers.  We *will* use `Range`s instead.  A `Range` is a type of collection

> A Range represents an intervalâ€”a set of values with a beginning and an end. 
 - http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Range.html

We create a `Range` by supplying a starting number and an ending number
```ruby
(1..10)

(1..10).size

(1..10).first

(1..10).last
```

`Range`s don't have to start at 0:
```ruby
(-7..13)

(-7..13).size

(-7..13).first

(-7..13).last
```

You can use variables to represent anything in Ruby, including a `Range`:

```ruby
two_through_eight = (2..8)

two_through_eight.min

two_through_eight.max

two_through_eight.minmax
```
