## Variables
A variable represents a value. You know variables from algebra, where they are usually numbers.
```ruby
a = 7

puts a
```

You can use a computer to do equations like you do in algebra, even when your equation has variables.  (`*` means 'multiply', and is sometimes called 'asterisk', 'star' or 'splat').
```ruby
a * 2
```

You _should_ use a computer to do equations like you do in algebra.
```ruby
a * 2908976890
```

Try experimenting with other math problems.  You should try some of the questions on your algebra assignment that's due tomorrow.
