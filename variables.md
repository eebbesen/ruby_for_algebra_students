### Variables
We're going to use Ruby as a calculator.  I like using Ruby as a calculator because I can assign variables easier than I can with a calculator.

A variable represents a value
```ruby
a = 'hi'
=> "hi"

a = 'bye'
=> "bye"
```

You know variables from algebra, where they are usually numbers
```ruby
a = 7
puts a
```

You can use a computer to do equations like you do in algebra.  (`*` means 'multiply', and is sometimes called 'asterisk', 'star' or 'splat')
```ruby
a * 2
```

You _should_ use a computer to do equations like you do in algebra
```ruby
a * 2908976890
```

Try experimenting with other math problems.  You should try some of the questions on your algebra assignment that's due tomorrow.


## `=>`

We're going to stop printing the `=>` stuff, but don't be surprised when you see it.  If you really want to know what it is for, try experimenting _or_ looking it up.
